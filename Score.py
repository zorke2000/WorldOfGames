# File: Score.py
# Purpose:
#   A package that is in charge of managing the scores file.
#   The scores file at this point will consist of only a number.
#   That number is the accumulation of the winnings of the user.
#   Amount of points for winning a game is as follows:
#       POINTS_OF_WINNING = DIFFICULTY X 3
#   Each time the user is winning a game, the points he won will be added to his current amount of
#   point saved in a file.

# Function: add_score
#   Purpose:
#   Return: none
#   Logic:
#       The functionâ€™s input is a variable named difficulty.
#       The function will read the current score in the scores file,
#       and will use it to save the current score.
