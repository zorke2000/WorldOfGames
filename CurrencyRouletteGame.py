# This game will use the free currency api to get the current exchange rate from USD to ILS.
# Will generate a new random number between 1-100 & will ask the user to find the value of
# the generated number from USD to ILS.
# Depending on the userâ€™s difficulty his answer will be correct if the guessed value is between
# the interval surrounding the correct answer.
